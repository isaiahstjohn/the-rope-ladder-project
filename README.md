# the-rope-ladder-project
A toolkit to help busy people master software development in their spare time.

## Summary
Not everyone can afford the time or cost of a bootcamp. There are many 
resources for the motivated learner
to teach themself software development,
but they do not address the specific
challenges of the busy, time starved
learner.

There are no magic shortcuts to learning
any complex skill. This is not that.
If it takes 1,000 hours to become an
entry level developer, we just want 
to spread that over, say, four years,
instead of four months.

The key problem to solve is not to 
forget what you learn on day one
by day 1,500. To do that we leverage
the idea of spaced repetition. A
second lever is to find ways to learn
in the odd and end moments through out the day.
We can use flashcards, audio books (or TTS of books),
audio/tts flashcards, podcasts, 
and yet-to-be-discovered tools
to leverage time throughout the
day to learn.

Finally, we can create and share
resources with one another to save
each other time.

## Challenges
- Forgetting over time

Spaced rep

- Limited time to study
Creative techniques

- Limited time to create study aids
Share resources

- Technology fads go out of style
after learning them
Prioritize learning time-tested 
technology:
SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Ruby,
Java

De-emphasize quickly changing and
possible fad tech:
React, Vue, Angular, and other 
libraries and frameworks. Go, Rust, 
Crystal, Nim, Typescript, Flow,
and other newer languages.

Learn a framework as a very last step
